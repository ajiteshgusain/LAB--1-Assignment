# 📅 Event Management System

A clean, responsive web application to manage upcoming events. This project was built to practice the core fundamentals of web development: **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## 🚀 Features
* **Add Events:** Input a title, date, category, and description to create a new event card.
* **Dynamic UI:** Events appear instantly on the dashboard without reloading the page.
* **Delete Events:** Remove specific events using the "X" button on each card.
* **Clear All:** Wipe the entire dashboard with a single click.
* **Responsive Design:** A two-column layout that organizes the form and the event list side-by-side.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Used for the semantic structure of the form and event containers.
* **CSS3:** Used for the layout (CSS Grid & Flexbox), styling, and color scheme.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Used for DOM manipulation, event handling, and form processing.
